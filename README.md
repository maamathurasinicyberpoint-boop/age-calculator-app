# Manoj Babu CSC

A web application that allows customers to order CSC (Common Service Centre) services for home delivery.

## Simple Login and Dashboards
This site includes a very simple, name-based login flow with two roles. No passwords or authentication are usedâ€”this is only for demo/navigation purposes.

- login.html: Enter a name and choose User Login or Admin Login.
  - User Login sends you to user-dashboard.html
  - Admin Login sends you to admin-dashboard.html
- user-dashboard.html: Greets you by name (reads ?name= from the URL) and provides quick links.
- admin-dashboard.html: Greets the admin by name (reads ?name=) and shows an admin badge with quick links.

Note: Because this is a static site demo, these pages do not implement real authentication or access control. Anyone can visit any page directly.

## Navigation
- Home page: index.html (now includes links to Login, User Dashboard, and Admin Dashboard)
- Login page: login.html
- User Dashboard: user-dashboard.html
- Admin Dashboard: admin-dashboard.html
